We propose a retinex improvement for nighttime image enhancement. Retinex is often used on images
under non-uniform illumination in terms of either color or lightness and has satisfactory results to achieve
color constancy and dynamic range compression. Few studies focus retinex on nighttime images, especially those under extreme conditions (i.e., images with over-lighted or extremely under-lighted areas or
with noise speckles), on which retinex operation can perform badly. Original multi-scale retinex (MSR)
is extremely sensitive to noise speckles that cameras produce in low light areas, and it has unsatisfactory
effect on areas with normal or intensive illumination. Moreover, original MSR uses a gain-offset method
for prior-to-display treatment and can lead to apparent data loss on nighttime images. This paper replaces
the logarithm function in MSR with a customized sigmoid function to minimize data loss, and adapts MSR
to nighttime images by merging results from sigmoid-MSR with original images. Experiments show our
framework, when applied to nighttime images, can preserve areas with normal or intensive lighting and
suppress noise speckles in extreme low light areas.Nighttime image enhancement is a particular problem of those
dealing with images with variant lighting conditions. Retinex, is
one effective theory aiming at simulating Human Visual System
(HVS) to achieve color constancy and dynamic range compression. This paper shows that with modifications, retinex can be
applicable to nighttime images even under extreme conditions. In
1986, Edwin Land [1] proposed the last version of his retinex theory as a model for human color constancy. Later, several works
emerged implementing this retinex theory but with huge computational cost and sometimes low performance in some extreme cases.
What caught our attention is the center/surround retinex, which
was also brought up by Edwin Land [2] and has the characteristics of easy implementation, fast computation and less parameters.
Research from NASA [3,4] further improved this c/s retinex leading
to what is called single-scale retinex (SSR) and multi-scale retinex
